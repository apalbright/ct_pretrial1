# The Dynamics of Pretrial Inmate Populations

- `ct_pretrial.Rmd` does all the analysis and visualization; it generates all the `png` images
- The notebook calls `CT-jail_1-8-19.csv`, which is the 1-8-19 downloaded version of [this spreadsheet via CT Open Data](https://data.ct.gov/Public-Safety/Accused-Pre-Trial-Inmates-in-Correctional-Faciliti/b674-jy6w)
    - The `csv` is too large to live on Github, but thankfully you can download the current one and subset dates to 1-8-19 if you want to exactly replicate my work
